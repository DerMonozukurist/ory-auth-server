# Development Guidelines

## Core Philosophy
Write code that is easy to read, easy to change, and easy to verify.
Every line should serve a clear purpose, express intent explicitly, and minimize cognitive load for future maintainers (including your future self).

## Clean Code
* Use descriptive, intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and classes

## Shell Scripts
* Use POSIX compliant shell syntax
* Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)
